# MicrocapCollector
A small pet project based on collecting low market cap cryptocurrencies for research purposes.

This project was built along the assistance of Scrapy, and also uses Numpy and Pandas in parts of it's code.
This project is mainly here for demonstration/review purposes, as well as better storage than just keeping on a flash drive that I'll probably lose at any second now.

If you have any questions or concerns about contributions to this project, please reach out to me, I'd love to hear it!

### THIS REPO IS MAINLY FOR CODE REVIEW PURPOSES, THE WEBSITES USED COULD HAVE CHANGED THEIR LAYOUT IN BETWEEN THE TIME OF CREATION AND THE PRESENT!
